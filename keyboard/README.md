# Keyboard layouts

I base my keyboard layouts on ANSI US, since that layout is pretty good for programming.
There are 2 main reasons for this project:

- I use Mac and Windows, and want to have the same layout and shortcuts
- I am Portuguese, and I want to be able to type comfortably in my native language

## US-PT

When possible, I have a layout called US-PT, that includes both layouts described bellow,
relying on `Caps Lock` to swap between them.

- `Caps Lock` *OFF* (default) -> US-PT-Dev
- `Caps Lock` *ON* -> US-PT-International

## US-PT-Dev

Focuses on programming or English typing, but adds the potential for typing in Portuguese:

- `Alt` + `[` `{` -> `~` `^` (*dead key*)
- `Alt` + `]` `}` -> `` ´ `` `` ` `` (*dead key*)
- `Alt` + `'` `"` -> `º` `ª`
- `Alt` + `c` -> `ç`
- `Alt` + `;` -> `ç`

## US-PT-International

Focused on Portuguese typing, with the potential to access the overridden keys:

- `[` `{` -> `~` `^` (*dead key*)
- `]` `}` -> `` ´ `` `` ` `` (*dead key*)
- `;` -> `;` / `ç` (*dead key* that changes the `;` to `ça` `ço` or `çu` when `a` `o` or `u` is pressed)
- `Alt` + `'` `"` -> `º` `ª`
- `Alt` + `c` -> `ç`
- `Alt` + `;` -> `ç`
